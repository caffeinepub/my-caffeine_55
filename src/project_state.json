  "summary": "Build a Persian-language AI chatbot named «ماما» with a core/central brain concept, supporting private and public chat, storing Q&A data for analysis, integrating external knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia), aiming for decentralized operation with transparent reporting, and additionally supporting a more “alive”/empathetic conversation mode for users to درد و دل. UI theme direction updated to a purple/blue/white/black palette.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Core concept: «مغز مرکزی» organized as 7 interwoven rings (flower-of-life) model.",
    "Chats are separated into private vs public spaces.",
    "System stores all Q&A interactions for later analysis and knowledge growth.",
    "Goal includes decentralized operation with transparency to users.",
    "Planned external knowledge integrations (Google/Wikipedia-like sources).",
    "UI theme palette preference changed to بنفش/آبی/سفید/سیاه (overrides prior ‘no blue/purple’ constraint).",
    "Performance direction request: optimize processing pipeline for higher throughput; user suggests moving from linear processing to vectorized/matrix-based processing where applicable.",
    "Conceptual dataflow metaphor: treat stored data as «خون» and each new message as «تپش»; each incoming message pushes data toward Mama’s «مغز مرکزی» and triggers refinement/processing across the 7 interwoven rings to produce new answers and feedback.",
    "User explicitly requests that «ماما» learn Persian better and be able to speak like a human (more natural Persian conversation quality).",
    "Do not use or reveal private-chat content in public responses; if leveraging private interactions for learning, only allow privacy-preserving aggregation/anonymized embeddings (no raw text, no principals), ideally behind explicit user consent and with anti-leak safeguards."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Conflict: existing UI theme requirement says not to use blue/purple as primary, but user now explicitly requests a purple/blue/white/black theme.",
    "Bug/regression: users cannot send messages to «ماما»; sending a message triggers an error (needs investigation and fix).",
    "Sending a message errors with a “connecting… / login” state; user cannot send messages to Mama (possibly an auth/connection loop).",
    "User reports repetitive predefined responses: Mama frequently replies with the same default messages (needs response variety / anti-repetition logic and/or better retrieval)."
